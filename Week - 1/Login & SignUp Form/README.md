During the 1st week of crework, we were given the task to make a replica of the following image with HTML only.

Below is the HTML-only Signup/Login module I created.

As of right now, I know enough CSS to replicate the reference picture. Therefore, I spent a few hours making my HTML Login/Signup module look like the reference image.
Unfortunately, I wasn't able to customize the "Sign up with Google" button specifically.
